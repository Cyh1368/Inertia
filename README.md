# Inertia
A physics simulation based on newton's law of motion, conservation of momentum and kinetic energy, etc.

# First change
I am changing this file for the first time.

# Current thoughts
1. Consider the collision of two sideways-moving boxes, the change in velocity shall only happen perpendicular to the side of collision, due to the absense of friction.
2. Frame rate bug
